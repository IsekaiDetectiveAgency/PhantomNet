# 🕳️ uBlock-Origin-Filters: PhantomNet (not many websites supported yet)

**My vision for the web is simple: Every site should do *one thing*, and do it well.**

- A video site should just show the video and the comments.  
- A post feed should just show the posts.  
- A chatbot should just respond with text.

That’s it. No popups. No floating bars. No emotional blackmail in the form of like buttons.  
Modern websites have lost the plot — they waste your screen space, eat your RAM, and demand attention you never wanted to give.

So I made this.

## 💥 What Is This?

This is a **custom uBlock Origin filter list** that **obliterates non-essential UI** across *all* websites — not just YouTube, Reddit, or ChatGPT. Every site. Everywhere. It’s built for people who want **speed**, **focus**, and **clean visuals**, not social fluff or empty UI noise.

### 🔨 What It Removes

- Like, share, and reply buttons  
- Social overlays and subscription nags  
- Profile pictures, avatars, and decorative images  
- Floating toolbars, sticky headers, interactive clutter  
- Useless sidebars, footers, widgets, pop-ins, prompts

### ✅ What It Keeps

- The **core content** — the thing you came to see  
- Anything essential for viewing or reading

> 💡 Ads are untouched — uBlock Origin handles those.  
> This ruleset exists solely to **strip out UI waste**.

## 🧠 Why I Made It

Because I don’t want to **interact** — I just want to **consume content**.

I never reply to comments. I don’t care who posted something. I don’t smash like buttons.  
All those elements do is take up space and slow things down. So I got rid of them.

Now, reading a comment section feels smooth and distraction-free. Watching a video feels quiet and focused.  
It’s like the internet finally shut up and let the content speak.

You might feel the same way. Or maybe you don’t. That’s fine — I actually encourage you to build your *own* ruleset based on *your* preferences. The web should serve *you*, not the other way around.

This is my version. PhantomNet.

🎯 Design Goals

    💀 Strip websites to their bare-bones function

    ⚡ Load fast, scroll smooth, stay lean

    🧠 Minimize distractions

    🖥️ Lower system usage — ideal for background browsing or low-power machines

    🔧 Fit my exact needs — no compromises

⚠️ Known Tradeoffs

    Some features will break. Interactive buttons and fancy UI elements won’t load.

    Ads will still show — this isn’t an ad blocker. It’s a UI cleaner.

    This ruleset is not for everyone. But if you want total focus and brutal speed, it might be exactly what you need.
